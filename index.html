                <p>
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScriptis extremely popular
                    for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for
                    developers to take in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host enviroment (a
                    web bowser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide
                    programmatic
                    control over them.

                    <ul>
                        <li><a
                                href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/variables/variable-declaration">Declaration</a>
                            JavaScript variables are containers for storring data values - imagine a
                            cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript
                            variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.
                            <span class="items">var x;</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_variables.asp">Variable Assignments</a>
                            Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee
                            poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value
                            to a variable. <span class="items">var x = 10;</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_data_types.asp">Data Taypes</a> Data types are
                            an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.
                            There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span
                                class="items">true</span> or <span class="items">false</span> null -
                            <span class="items">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="items">42</span> or <span
                                class="items">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="items">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span>
                            Array - <span class="items">[1,'coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span
                                class="items">{first_name:'Jane', last_name:'Doe'}</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp">Conditionals</a> When you write code,
                            you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code
                            blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditionals statements
                            in your code to accomplish this. there are the following conditional statement: <span
                                class="items">if</span> a
                            specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="items">else
                                if</span> to specify a new
                            condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="items">else</span> we
                            execute this block of code;
                        </li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp">Loops</a> There are many different
                            kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing:
                            they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you
                            run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp">Function</a> Functions are an
                            encaspulation of a code block. When we call our funcion this will run that code block. Think
                            of it as a list of instuctions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from
                            Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the
                            table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions.
                            Sadly, there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over
                            again.</li>
